# Think-Big Backend Meeting

**I.** We agreed to work with [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

 - Greatly simplifies the login system by using `0auth` through Discord.
 - Provides more streamlined interactions with [`React`](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

**II.** We discussed the possibility of using [`Mantine`](https://mantine.dev/pages/basics/) because of the many `React` components and themes it provides.

 - Includes [`calendar integration`](https://mantine.dev/dates/calendars).

**III.** We agreed to use `MongoDB` as our database.
 - `MongoDB` will scale to our needs.
 - `MongoDB` integrates well with `Next.js`.
 - `MongoDB` is the path of least resistance.

**IV.** We agreed to use `GitHub`'s integrated `scrum` board.
 - This will reduce the segregation and complexity of our tools.

**V.** We discussed the possibility of using [`Vercel`](https://vercel.com) for hosting instead of [`Heroku`](https://heroku.com).
 - `Vercel` has excellent support for `Next.js`.
 - Has similar free tier options to `Heroku`.

## Let's Talk Data

- When a user creates an account, they will have to use their Discord login credentials. The `Next.js oauth module` will create an object in mongoDB that will have its own `_id`.

- We can add separate arrays of classes & assignments to each user object which are essentially arrays of table ids.

- We could have separate arrays that list which classes & assignments that have been completed.

- This same approach can be used for anything we want to add in the future.

## Two Week Break!

**We will reconvene in 2 weeks to gauge everyone's comfort level. Please take the next two weeks getting caught up if you're behind.**

This means understanding how to implement `API`s and `CRUD` using `node.js`, `express.js` & `mongoDB`. Most of us need to do this, so if you need help, please collaborate with everyone else who is catching up.

**While you're away, please clone the [`GitHub repo`](https://github.com/100Devs-ADHD/think-big). To open up the repo in `VSCode`, please do the following:**

`File > Open Workspace from File... > /path/to/repo/think-big.code-workspace`

This will automatically import the project in a way that is more compatible with `Next.js` and it will recommend some useful `VSCode` extensions that will make working on this project easier.
